    <div class="news-content">## IHG Premier Business Card: 200,000 Bonus Points – Don't Miss Out!

Are you looking to maximize your travel rewards?  Then listen up!  The IHG Premier Business Card is offering a *massive* limited-time bonus, and you don't want to miss this.  We're talking a potential **200,000 IHG One Rewards points**, a deal so good it's practically screaming from the rooftops (or, you know, from this blog post).

This isn't just any bonus; it's the best welcome offer I've ever seen on this card.  As a seasoned points and miles enthusiast, I've seen my fair share of deals, and this one truly stands out.  Let's dive into the details.

**The Sweet Deal: 200,000 IHG One Rewards Points**

Until **Wednesday, April 30, 2025**, you can snag a whopping 200,000 IHG One Rewards points by meeting the following spending requirements:

* **140,000 points:** Spend $4,000 in the first three months.
* **60,000 points:** Spend an additional $5,000 within the first six months (bringing your total spending to $9,000).

That's a potential $1,000 value (based on my valuation of IHG points at 0.5 cents each), all for meeting some reasonable spending goals.  Previously, the bonus capped at 140,000 points – this is a significant upgrade!

**Why This Card is a Must-Have**

Beyond the incredible bonus, the IHG Premier Business Card offers a suite of valuable ongoing perks that make it a worthwhile addition to any frequent traveler's wallet:

* **IHG One Rewards Platinum Status:** Instantly upgrade your status, unlocking benefits like bonus points, room upgrades, and late check-out.  This alone can save you money and enhance your hotel experiences.  Think of those complimentary breakfast buffets!

* **Potential for IHG One Rewards Diamond Status:**  Spend $40,000 on the card in a calendar year and unlock Diamond status, the highest tier in the IHG program.  This opens the door to even more luxurious perks.

* **Annual Free Night Certificate:**  Enjoy a free night at an IHG hotel every year, valid at properties costing up to 40,000 points.  This is perfect for a weekend getaway or a luxurious staycation.

* **United TravelBank Credit:**  Receive up to $50 in United TravelBank credit annually, perfect for topping up your travel fund.

* **Fourth Night Free on Award Redemptions:**  Stretch your points further with a free night on award stays.

* **Global Entry/TSA PreCheck Credit:**  Every four years, you can get reimbursed for the cost of Global Entry or TSA PreCheck, saving you a significant amount of money.

**Real-World Example:**

Imagine using your free night certificate at a luxurious IHG property like the InterContinental Bora Bora Resort & Thalasso Spa.  Or perhaps redeeming your points for a family vacation at a Holiday Inn Express near your favorite theme park. The possibilities are endless!

**Who Should Apply?**

This offer is perfect for:

* Business owners looking to maximize rewards on business expenses.
* Frequent travelers who stay at IHG properties.
* Anyone looking to earn a substantial number of points quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* You're not eligible for this bonus if you've had this specific card before. However, you *are* eligible if you've held the personal IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card or IHG One Rewards Traveler Credit Card.
* Standard Chase application rules apply.
