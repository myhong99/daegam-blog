For years, Air New Zealand's business class has been a bit of a… let's say, *underachiever*. While their innovative SkyNest economy sleep pods have garnered significant attention, their business class offering felt stuck in the past.  But finally, after years of anticipation and several delays, Air New Zealand is set to launch a revamped business class experience starting May 2025.  Let's delve into what we can expect.  **Two Classes of Business: Premier and Premier Luxe**  Air New Zealand isn't just offering one new business class; they're introducing *two*: Business Premier and Business Premier Luxe.  This tiered approach aims to cater to different needs and budgets.  **Business Premier: A Solid, if Unremarkable, Upgrade**  The Business Premier seats will be a welcome improvement over the current offering.  Expect:  * **Herringbone Configuration:** While all seats face the aisle (a plus for privacy), the herringbone layout is a bit of a head-scratcher in 2025.  Many airlines are moving towards reverse herringbone for better window views and even more privacy. * **Spacious, but Doorless:**  The seats themselves are generously sized (20.5" wide, extending to an 80.25" flat bed), boasting 24" personal televisions, ample power outlets, and Bluetooth audio.  However, the lack of doors is a noticeable omission, especially when compared to the increasingly popular suite-style offerings from competitors. * **Configuration Variations:** Depending on the aircraft and route, you'll find either 22 or 34 Business Premier seats.  Think of Business Premier as a solid, comfortable upgrade, but not a revolutionary leap forward.  It's a step in the right direction, but not quite a game-changer.  Consider this comparable to a well-appointed hotel room – comfortable and functional, but lacking the "wow" factor of a luxury suite.   **Business Premier Luxe: The Real Star of the Show**  This is where things get interesting.  Business Premier Luxe seats are designed to be a premium business class experience, offering:  * **Enhanced Space and Privacy:** Located at the bulkhead, these seats offer significantly more space, including an ottoman and, crucially, a privacy door.  This is a significant upgrade, providing a much more secluded and luxurious experience. * **Elevated Dining:**  The larger tray table even allows for dining with a companion.  Think of Business Premier Luxe as that luxury hotel suite – spacious, private, and offering a truly elevated experience.  The upgrade cost from Business Premier to Business Premier Luxe is significant (250 NZD for short-haul, 820 NZD for long-haul), but the added privacy and space might be worth it for many travelers.  This is comparable to JetBlue's Mint Studio, Virgin Atlantic's Retreat Suite, or Condor's Prime Seats – premium products within a premium cabin.   **Rollout and Availability**  The first Boeing 787 with the new cabins is expected to enter service in May 2025.  Air New Zealand aims to retrofit all 14 existing Dreamliners by the end of 2026.  New 787 deliveries, initially slated for 2025, have been delayed until at least 2026.  **The Verdict: A Mixed Bag**  Air New Zealand's new business class is a bit of a mixed bag.  While Business Premier represents a decent upgrade, its lack of doors and standard herringbone configuration feel somewhat dated.  Business Premier Luxe, however, is a compelling offering, providing a truly premium experience.  The rollout will be gradual, so be sure to check the aircraft configuration before booking.  The long wait for this upgrade has certainly been testing for frequent flyers, but the final product may be worth the wait, especially if you can snag a Business Premier Luxe seat.   **What are your thoughts on Air New Zealand's new business class?
